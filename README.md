## GAME DESCRIPTION

You will be working with basic objects and various Python data structures in order to develop a simple console-based game that allows people to test their memory. The idea is as follows.
The game will display a square grid, with the columns labeled with letters, and the rows with numbers. Elements within the grid will be associated with pairs of integers (a pair of 0’s, and pair or 1’s, a pair of 2’s, etc.). Initially, we will not be able to see any of the numbers, as they will be hidden by ‘X’ symbols. Your job as a player is to find the hidden pairs in as few guesses as possible. A simple menu will allow you to interact with the game.

So let’s look at an example. The image to the right displays the game interface when using a 4x4 grid. You will note the following:
• The title “PEEK-A-BOO” is displayed first.
• Next, we have the grid. Column names use letters (A to D in this case), while rows are labeled with numbers (0 to 3 in this case).
• Any individual cell in the grid is identified by a letter/number combination (e.g., A0, B2).
• When the game begins, all cells display an X (i.e., the number in the cell is ‘hidden’).
• Below the grid is a simple menu that allows you to play the game.
• The game title, grid, and menu will be displayed at all times.
Before we go any further, let’s look at the pattern of numbers that are actually hidden behind the X symbols.
You will notice that Menu Option 3 is entitled “I give up – reveal the grid”. In short, this ends the game and displays all hidden numbers. So if we select that option, we might see a grid display that looks like the image below.

<img width="262" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 3 01 11 PM" src="https://github.com/anuragagarwal6895/guess-grid-game/assets/117996954/3f045ee7-79a0-4994-bb7a-a340946152a7">

Note that a 4 x 4 grid has 16 cells in total. As such, it will hold 8 pairs of integers (from a pair of 0’s up to a pair of 7’s). In contrast, a 6 x 6 grid has 36 cells and therefore 18 pairs of integers (from 0’s up to 17’s).
So when a new game is started, the grid must be initialized with a new set of pairs, which should be randomly distributed throughout the grid. To demonstrate this feature, we can use Menu Option 4 to start a new game, and then use Menu Option 3 to reveal the new distribution.
If we do that, we might see the set of numbers shown in the image on the left. Note that we again have 8 pairs of integers but the values are distributed in a completed different way. This, of course, is important since the player must not be able to simply memorize a fixed pattern.
Okay, so that’s what the numbers would look like. So back to the game itself. Again, when we start a new game, all we see is a grid of X symbols. Our job is to find the pairs. We will do this primarily by
selecting Menu Option 1, which will allow us to specify a pair of cells to test. When we do this, we will be prompted to enter the first cell (using the letter/number format) and then the second cell (i.e., there will be two separate input prompts, once for each cell). So the two input prompts will appear below the menu and might look like this:

<img width="503" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 3 01 41 PM" src="https://github.com/anuragagarwal6895/guess-grid-game/assets/117996954/75f9ccb9-1856-4684-abe7-28bcbdd97584">

Note that column letters may be given either as upper case or lower case (e.g., A or a). In any case, once this selection is made, the contents of the two cells will be revealed (i.e., the two X’s will be replaced by the integers associated with each of the two cells. Early in the game, it is likely that your pair will not match, as depicted by the figure below (A0 = 7, B0 = 0). In this case, the two numbers will remain visible for 2 seconds, at which point they will be replaced by X’s again. As a player, your job is to try to remember the contents of these cells as you uncover other cells in the grid, so that you can eventually match them with the proper cell.
Of course, if the two cells match, then the numbers will remain visible and the player continues to search for other pairs.
It is also possible for a player to manually turn cells over if they want to solve the game a little more quickly. To do so, they will select Menu Option 2. In this case, they will be prompted to enter the coordinates for a single cell. The associated X will be immediately replaced by the number in that cell.
So that’s the basic idea. Using Menu Options 1 and 2 (but mostly Option 1), the player will work through the grid until she/he has uncovered all of the pairs in the grid. At that point the game will indicate that the player has won and will provide a score.
What is this score? In short, it is a number between 0 and 100 (higher is better) that represents how quickly the player was able to find all pairs. Basically, the score reflects the number of guesses actually taken versus the minimum number actually required. So, for example, the minimum number of guesses for a 4 x 4 grid would be 8 (one guess for each valid pair). If the player actually uses just 8 guesses (VERY unlikely), they will get a score of 100. The score itself is a very simple calculation, and is computed as follows:

Score = (minimum_possible_guesses / actual_guesses) * 100

That’s it – the closer your actual guess count is to the minimum possible number of guesses, the closer your score will be to 100.
Note: Using Option 2 counts as two guesses, so using it a lot will produce a very low score. The figure below illustrates the display when the player wins.

In this case, the player has solved the puzzle but has done so in 4 guesses, which is twice as many as the minimum required for a 2 x 2 grid. So her score is 50.0.
Important: If a player solves the puzzle and has done so by making at least one valid guess, then the score will always be greater than 0.
So how does a player actually get a score of 0? Using the example above, it would be possible to use Menu Option 2 to manually uncover each of the four cells, without ever making a single guess. In this case, the victory message would be replaced by the following text:

In practice, the game may be played with either a 2x2 grid, a 4x4 grid, or a 6x6 grid. The size of the grid will be passed as a command line argument when the program is run (i.e., either 2, 4, or 6).
One last thing that has to be mentioned is that the program must have basic error checking. Otherwise, the program will fail constantly, as the player accidentally inputs a bad selection. The error checking includes:
1. Check the command line argument to make sure that a 2, 4, or 6 has been specified. The program can be stopped immediately if the grid size is invalid.
2. Check the menu option selections. It must be a number between 1 and 5. If a bad selection has been made, the player must be informed and asked to enter the option again (the program should NOT just stop).
3. The cell coordinates must be verified to ensure that the column (a letter) and the row (the number) are valid for this grid. If not, the player should be informed and asked to enter the cell(s) again. The image below illustrates user feedback when invalid entries are made. Note as well that the player should not be able to enter the same cell twice when making a guess (e.g., a0 and a0). This will make things easier for you.
